  - InnerString:
    - I just got my MBA from Harvard last year
    - It was incredibly challenging ballancing a rigorus course workload with a full
      time job.
    - I decided I wanted to go back to school and further my education as I saw it
      as one of the best ways to better myself and boost my career,,,,,
    - I really struggled with my Accounting courses as some of the math was a little
      overwhelming ,,,,,
    - It was a very difficult challenge but looking back on it is really rewarding,,,,,
  - InnerString:
    - I'm happy I moved back out here where I am close to my family again.,,,,,
    - My parents have a house in the next town over, so I go out and visit them fairly
      often
    - Its also nice as my boyfriend's family is not too far away either so we visit
      them but less regularly,,,,,
    - My boyfriend, Steve, and I have been dating for 2 years next month, we met
      while studying at Harvard. , ,,,,
    - We moved in together about 6 months ago and its been going great,, so a trip
      to Disney Land would be perfect. ,,,
  - InnerString:
    - I just got hired 2 years ago to be the Vice President of Finance.,,,,,
    - My daily work is pretty much sending emails and reviewing files, and coordinating
      larger scale projects
    - It is a very challenging job but it is really rewarding when I see everything
      come together,,,,,
    - I work a lot with John, who has a strong work ethic
    - I am hoping to soon get premoted again as I want to keep growing my career,,,,,
  - InnerString:
    - When I first got here it was a slightly slow start trying to learn the enviroment
      but everyone was super supportive,,,,,
    - The company has been growing a Iot in the past few years so there is always
      something changing,,,,,
    - Despite the rapid growth we are trying hard to stay connected as an organization
      so we try to do non work related events at least once a month,,,,,
    - My only complaint about the company as there is a disconnect with some of the
      higher managment levels, I am trying to cover most of the gaps but some things
      keep slipping through,,,,,
    - In general this company has been a great place to work, and as a VP I am trying
      too keep pushing it farther forward, if there is anything you need or that
      I can do to help please let me or John know. ,,, but after that, I can't promise
      anything. It is a dog eat dog world out there. Well, you will see.
