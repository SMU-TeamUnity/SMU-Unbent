    - Oh, that was a distant memory. I graduated from Duke University many years
      ago. ,,,,
    - I was lucky to graduate in four years, there was this one professor Dr. Rob
      whose classes were brutal.,,,,
    - The hardest class by far was the micro-economics course I was so happy when
      I got through it with a B. I almost felt like the professor had it out for
      me. ,,,,,
    - Since graduating I have started to think about going back for my MBA but I
      am not sure if it is the best bet for me yet. I think it might be tough being
      a non-traditional student and going back to school with a family. ,,,,,
    - And I want to continue my education but the balancing of being a non-traditional
      with school is just tough. I would have to take a business analytics course
      and I was never really good at math when I took micro-economics.,,,,,
  - InnerString:
    - I met my partner Juan in Duke at a coffee shop around the corner from where
      we went to school.,,,,,
    - I can speak all day about Juan and our daugher. My daughter is going to school
      for the first time next week. Honestly, I am a little nervous about it.,,,,
    - We will have been maried for 3 years now in December and it was one of the
      toughest challenges trying to get Tonie our daugher. You wouldn't believe what
      we had to go through. ,,,,,
    - The paperwork for a couple like us and the stigma just for us to adopt was
      tough. Many assumptions of course were made about our abilities to raise a
      child. It was even tough with our family, some of which who didn't want to
      see us. I hope my whole family can accept us for who we are. You know?,,,,
    - A family trip might help the family. It also might help the family learn to
      accept us and get to know Tonie a bit more. I guess you could say that growing
      up was rough, but one day I know my parents will come around. My parents were
      very structured in their ways and how they raised me and my sister Cassie.
      She has a husband and two kids of her own in California, so a trip to Disney
      Land would be perfect. ,,,

    - I work as a middle manager at the Firm and it is my 8th year in the company.,,,,,
    - My typical day involves coordinating with other employees to see what they
      need to get their jobs done, talking with the higher ups to give estimates
      on schedule and put in requests and all around just working to keep things
      running smoothly.,,,,
    - I got promoted three years ago after working as an analayst for a few years.
      However, ever since they hired Sarah it seems like the CEO has been looking
      to her to drive all our company decisions. So who knows how much longer I will
      be around. But you know how it is.
    - Of course, I need to report the department's progress once a week to my supervisor
      and that is now Sarah. I feel like she doesn't really see my potential and
      what I can bring to the table. Last week I spent five hours analyzing some
      of the data for a report. She didn't even say thank you when I handed her the
      report. ,,,,
    - Sometimes I'm so busy that I'm thinking I really need an assistant hahah. But
      then, now that I am feeling stifled, I am starting to think that I might just
      leave the firm and go somwhere where I feel valued. ,,,
  - InnerString:
    - I came to the company 8 years ago and I don't remember ever having issues or
      problems fitting in with the company.,,,,,
    - Obviously it was very different between now and then, we were a very small
      group at that point and now the company has grown a lot in size.,,,,
    - One of the things we try to do is monthly team lunches so we can all get a
      chance to connect outside of a work enviroment. I stopped going to the lunches
      though, mainly because of how I was being treated by my supervisor. Really
      it was just a lack of appreciation for what effort I was putting in.
    - My supervisor at one point told me they really had no care for what I was putting
      forward. I have asked about gaps and where I can improve, but I have yet to
      see any type of 360 degree evaluaiton of my work. You would think around here
      that they would start assessing the company enviroment a bit more and looking
      at evaluation of our management, but nope.,,,
    - As a middle manager,I will do anything to make sure my team members fit in
      the company smoothly, so let me know where you need help. I will try to train
      you for as long as I am around, but after that, I can't promise anything. It
      is a dog eat dog world out there. Well, you will see.
