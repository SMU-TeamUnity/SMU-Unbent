A1;Oh, that was a distant memory. I graduated from Duke University many years ago. ,,,,;I just got my MBA from Harvard last year
A2;I was lucky to graduate in four years, there was this one professor Dr. Rob whose classes were brutal.,,,,;It was incredibly challenging ballancing a rigorus course workload with a full time job.
A3;The hardest class by far was the micro-economics course I was so happy when I got through it with a B. I almost felt like the professor had it out for me. ,,,,,;I decided I wanted to go back to school and further my education as I saw it as one of the best ways to better myself and boost my career,,,,,
A4;Since graduating I have started to think about going back for my MBA but I am not sure if it is the best bet for me yet. I think it might be tough being a non-traditional student and going back to school with a family. ,,,,,;I really struggled with my Accounting courses as some of the math was a little overwhelming ,,,,,
A5;And I want to continue my education but the balancing of being a non-traditional with school is just tough. I would have to take a business analytics course and I was never really good at math when I took micro-economics.,,,,,;It was a very difficult challenge but looking back on it is really rewarding,,,,,
B1;I met my partner Juan in Duke at a coffee shop around the corner from where we went to school.,,,,,;I'm happy I moved back out here where I am close to my family again.,,,,,
B2;I can speak all day about Juan and our daugher. My daughter is going to school for the first time next week. Honestly, I am a little nervous about it.,,,,;My parents have a house in the next town over, so I go out and visit them fairly often
B3;We will have been maried for 3 years now in December and it was one of the toughest challenges trying to get Tonie our daugher. You wouldn't believe what we had to go through. ,,,,,;Its also nice as my boyfriend's family is not too far away either so we visit them but less regularly,,,,,
B4;The paperwork for a couple like us and the stigma just for us to adopt was tough. Many assumptions of course were made about our abilities to raise a child. It was even tough with our family, some of which who didn't want to see us. I hope my whole family can accept us for who we are. You know?,,,,;My boyfriend, Steve, and I have been dating for 2 years next month, we met while studying at Harvard. , ,,,,
B5;A family trip might help the family. It also might help the family learn to accept us and get to know Tonie a bit more. I guess you could say that growing up was rough, but one day I know my parents will come around. My parents were very structured in their ways and how they raised me and my sister Cassie. She has a husband and two kids of her own in California, so a trip to Disney Land would be perfect. ,,,;We moved in together about 6 months ago and its been going great,, so a trip to Disney Land would be perfect. ,,,
C1;I work as a middle manager at the Firm and it is my 8th year in the company.,,,,,;I just got hired 2 years ago to be the Vice President of Finance.,,,,,
C2;My typical day involves coordinating with other employees to see what they need to get their jobs done, talking with the higher ups to give estimates on schedule and put in requests and all around just working to keep things running smoothly.,,,,;My daily work is pretty much sending emails and reviewing files, and coordinating larger scale projects
C3;I got promoted three years ago after working as an analayst for a few years. However, ever since they hired Sarah it seems like the CEO has been looking to her to drive all our company decisions. So who knows how much longer I will be around. But you know how it is.;It is a very challenging job but it is really rewarding when I see everything come together,,,,,
C4;Of course, I need to report the department's progress once a week to my supervisor and that is now Sarah. I feel like she doesn't really see my potential and what I can bring to the table. Last week I spent five hours analyzing some of the data for a report. She didn't even say thank you when I handed her the report. ,,,,;I work a lot with John, who has a strong work ethic
C5;Sometimes I'm so busy that I'm thinking I really need an assistant hahah. But then, now that I am feeling stifled, I am starting to think that I might just leave the firm and go somwhere where I feel valued. ,,,;I am hoping to soon get premoted again as I want to keep growing my career,,,,,
D1;I came to the company 8 years ago and I don't remember ever having issues or problems fitting in with the company.,,,,,;When I first got here it was a slightly slow start trying to learn the enviroment but everyone was super supportive,,,,,
D2;Obviously it was very different between now and then, we were a very small group at that point and now the company has grown a lot in size.,,,,;The company has been growing a Iot in the past few years so there is always something changing,,,,,
D3;One of the things we try to do is monthly team lunches so we can all get a chance to connect outside of a work enviroment. I stopped going to the lunches though, mainly because of how I was being treated by my supervisor. Really it was just a lack of appreciation for what effort I was putting in.;Despite the rapid growth we are trying hard to stay connected as an organization so we try to do non work related events at least once a month,,,,,
D4;My supervisor at one point told me they really had no care for what I was putting forward. I have asked about gaps and where I can improve, but I have yet to see any type of 360 degree evaluaiton of my work. You would think around here that they would start assessing the company enviroment a bit more and looking at evaluation of our management, but nope.,,,;My only complaint about the company as there is a disconnect with some of the higher managment levels, I am trying to cover most of the gaps but some things keep slipping through,,,,,
D5;As a middle manager,I will do anything to make sure my team members fit in the company smoothly, so let me know where you need help. I will try to train you for as long as I am around, but after that, I can't promise anything. It is a dog eat dog world out there. Well, you will see.;In general this company has been a great place to work, and as a VP I am trying too keep pushing it farther forward, if there is anything you need or that I can do to help please let me or John know. ,,, but after that, I can't promise anything. It is a dog eat dog world out there. Well, you will see.
